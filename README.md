# tictactoe-network

TicTacToe Terminal Application with up to 2 player which can play over network.

This was a project first touched within my dual study at the company [IT-Designers GmbH](https://it-designers.de/). The basic client and game rules where made initially by colleague [ChrisThor](https://github.com/christhor). I just did the server-client protocol implementation.

Looking back from current standpoint of life it's pretty bad code, but we both did learn a lot of stuff in this little project.

Anyone is free to use it and develop further.
